5. How would you pass different arguments to the functions?
a) Different arguments can be paased to function by using the "echo" command.
Example: echo “Hello, FaaS, World” | faas-cli invoke figlet
We have invoked the figlet function using the above command with the argument to
the function that is, “Hello,FaaS World”. 
b) We can also pass arguments from OpenFaas Portal from the Request Body section.

6. How would you change the slack-interactive function to react to different inputs?
The urllib is a package in which the unquote function is defined in handler.py (slack-interactive function).
It is used to decode any string into a URL.
We are utilizing the json.loads() method to parse a JSON string, that is the URL string , into a Python dictionary. This information is saved in the response.
We may change the slack-interactive function to react to different inputs by passing a JSON as input in OpenFaas gateway UI or while invoking the function command line.
The response will be a python dictionary and it will be converted to a JSON string by json.dumps().
